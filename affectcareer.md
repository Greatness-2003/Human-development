#### Write 1-2 paragraphs on the following: From what you know about your prospective major, what is a permanent or semi-permanent way the pandemic has affected your field of study or an aspect of culture or society related to your field? Do you believe the change is a net-positive or negative for society and why? What recommendations (if any) would you have for your field moving forward on the issue? For example, if you're a prospective business major, what are your thoughts on remote work and the use of office spaces and how businesses could think about "where" to work moving forward? Or, if you're a prospective psychology or sociology major, how has the virus and pandemic changed how people and societies view and react to germs? 

The COVID-19 pandemic brought economies around the world to a standstill. In turn, businesses needed access to accurate, timely data more than ever before. As a result, the demand for data analytics skyrocketed as businesses tried to navigate an uncertain future. The pandemic has brought the importance of data analytics sharply into focus. The need to extract and analyze data quickly, even in real-time, has only increased with the pandemic. Consequently, there is a growing interest from investors in the potential of big data analytics.

However, there is a catch. The severe slump in consumer demand across industries has left several businesses wanting. People are staring at an uncertain future, which has led them to curb their spending. This slump has affected the bottom line of enterprises, which means lower budgets. With limited budgets, research expects enterprises to be conservative in their spending on big data solutions, despite the growth in interest. This could affect the actual demand for big data analytics over the next couple of years.
