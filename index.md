##### Do you think additional information or data could be added to the HDI calculation to possibly improve it or make it a more accurate measurement of human development? If yes, what things? If no, why no? Keep in mind the conversation with Tyler Cowen.


I do not think that additional data could be added to the HDI calculation to make it more accurate. There are a lot of things you could add, but I believe the three dimensions already encompass life in its entirety. The index currently measures health, wealth and knowledge and I believe every other aspect of life falls under these three. Other issues like poverty, innovation is improved when there is wealth and knowledge. Other measures of well-being correlate strongly with high GDP. Itâ€™s countries with high GDP that have good degree of equality.
