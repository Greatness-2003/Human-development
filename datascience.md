Think about an area of study or field you care about (outside of your formal assignment topic), maybe the major you intend to choose. Based on what you read and know about data science and its related areas (data analysis, stats, and ML), briefly (1-2 paragraphs) write about how you think these disciplines could possibly be used in your field (it's okay to think ambitiously). If methods are already being used, what are they and to what extent (if you know)? If you are a prospective data science major, what ideas do you have for how data science could be used in ways you believe they are currently not? 

As a prospective data science major, I’m not sure of ways data can be used that it is not being used. So I’ll focus on areas where its being used, with respect to Africa. Data science is being used address Africa’s most important societal challenges and capitalize on opportunities for economic growth. For example, data science can be used to improve healthcare in Africa. By collecting information about which illnesses affect which areas the most, scientists can work out how to spread resources so that more people get the care that they need. This could be especially useful in rural, isolated communities, where getting to a doctor can be difficult.
Data science is used to match resources to people living in poverty. This helps in the allocation of loans etc.
