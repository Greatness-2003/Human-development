# Literature Review: Malaria Analysis in Nigeria

## Introduction
Malaria is a global disease that has plagued the nations of Africa for years. It is a major cause of high mortality rates, child deaths, and also plays a major role in economic distress, poverty and underdevelopment. In my literature review, I will be reviewing the methods and methodologies used in different articles and situations to grasp and determine risk factors, preventions and variations needed if the disease is to be tackled. 
Amartya Sen defines development as the process of increasing the freedoms people enjoy. This is in contrast to the general view that development is an association with gross national product, industrialization etc. These freedoms which Sen associates development with include political freedom and quality of life, economic freedom, social opportunities. One of the perspectives of freedom which Sen states is mortality, which encompasses such things as disease. My topic Malaria Analysis in Nigeria seeks to talk on the methods malaria denies people's freedoms in Nigeria and the methods/methodologies being used to prevent it.


## Nigeria
Nigeria is a malaria endemic country in sub-Saharan Africa that has continuously recorded a high burden of malaria morbidity and mortality, especially in the under-5 group (WHO, 2018). Unlike many other subSaharan African countries, which have recorded a significant decline in malaria burden, the number of malaria cases in Nigeria increased with about 500,000 in 2017 (WHO, 2018). Although the mortality rate decreased from about 202 deaths per 1,000 live births to 129 deaths per 1,000 live births between 2003 to 2013 in the under-5 group, statistics show that malaria accounts for approximately 30% of all deaths in this part of the population in Nigeria. Resolution no. 3 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the United Nations (UN, 2018), concerns health, the worldwide improvement of which requires reduction of the malaria burden and its associated mortality as outlined by WHO (2019). Nigeria accounts for more than 25% of the world’s malaria burden, more than any other country, with an estimated 59 million cases and 119,000 malaria attributable deaths in 2013. Almost one in five deaths of Nigerian children under five were due to malaria, and malaria contributed to an estimated 11% of Nigerian maternal mortality. Since 2009, a 10% reduction in incidence has been observed following large, donor funded campaigns to distribute LLINs. In addition, a series of performance-based contracts between the World Bank and the Nigerian InterFaith Action Association (NIFAA) has resulted in increased utilization of programmes such as IPTp and LLINs.


## Research and Methodologies

This research was done by the writers to determine the hotspots where malaria is most prevalent and several risk factors of malaria in Nigerian children. Information such as this is necessary in the efforts to prevent and eradicate malaria. 
The method used in the paper is mostly geospatial. The data was obtained from the Nigeria Malaria Indicator Survey(NMIS). The sampling frame was based on the 2006 population census value, 140431790. Through a process called two-stage probability sampling, 333 clusters were chosen from across the country. This was made up of 138 urban and 195 rural clusters. In the second stage, 25 houses were selected from each cluster and women aged 15-49 years from each household were interviewed, and children aged 6-59 months from the same household were tested for malaria. The aim was to build a linear regression model to determine. The target was the binary value of 0 and 1, where 1 represents a positive result and 0 signifies absence of malaria. The features or determinants included factors such as education level of the mother, sex, age, use of Long-Lasting Insecticidal Nets(LLINs) and other environmental and socio-economic variables. The writers employed the Generalized Linear Mixed Models(GLMM), which accounts for spatial correlation to fit the prevalence data. 
A map was built showing the several hotspots where malaria is prevalent. The results indicated that Zamfara, Kebbi, Sokoto, Gombe, Adamawa, and Jigawa have the highest risk of under-5 malaria prevalence. There were followed by another 5 states, which including the 6 are all located in the Northern region of Nigeria. The study showed that South-west states had the lowest risk.
The conclusion of this study is that NGOs, health organizations and practitioners working towards the eradication of malaria in Nigeria should focus on children between 39-59 months, living with illiterate mothers in rural areas.

The high burden of malaria in Nigeria and limited funding makes it necessary to maximize the allocative efficiency of malaria control programmes. There are a lot of cost-effective interventions available to reduce the burden of malaria. These are vector control, including long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs), indoor residual spraying (IRS) and larval source management (LSM). Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) is highly effective at treating clinical malaria and has contributed significantly to major reductions (~40%) in the global burden of malaria since being introduced in the 2000s. However, limited funding to implement these interventions has resulted in substantial gaps in malaria control in the country. Quantitative tools are urgently needed to guide budget allocation decisions. 
Data was obtained from Malaria Atlas Project(MAP), while the mortality data was collected from the UN population division. A geospatial epidemic model was coupled with costing data and an optimization algorithm to estimate the optimal allocation of budgeted and projected funds across all malaria intervention approaches. Interventions included long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs), indoor residual spraying (IRS), intermittent presumptive treat‑ ment during pregnancy (IPTp), seasonal mass chemoprevention in children (SMC), larval source management (LSM), mass drug administration (MDA), and behavioural change communication (BCC). The model was applied to six geo‑ political regions of Nigeria in isolation and also the nation as a whole to minimize incidence and malaria-attributable mortality. 
The result of this study was as follows: Allocative efficiency gains could avert approximately 84,000 deaths or 15.7 million cases of malaria in Nigeria over 5 years. With an additional US$300 million available, approximately 134,000 deaths or 37.3 million cases of malaria could be prevented over 5 years. Priority funding should go to LLINs, IPTp and BCC programmes, and SMC should be expanded in seasonal areas. To minimize mortality, treatment expansion is critical and prioritized over some LLIN funding, while to minimize incidence, LLIN funding remains a priority. For areas with lower rainfall, LSM is prior‑ itized over IRS but MDA is not recommended unless all other programmes are established. 
Conclusions: Substantial reductions in malaria morbidity and mortality can be made by optimal targeting of invest‑ ments to the right malaria interventions in the right areas

Despite being preventable, malaria is a leading cause of mortality in Nigeria, second only to HIV/AIDS. However, malaria is not equally spread out in the country. This study produced a map showing the prevalence of malaria in states in Nigeria. The analysis was based on data obtained from Mapping Malaria Risk in Africa(MARA). In case the data obtained from MARA proved to be old, the author collected more recent and complete ones from several universities in the country, while some were obtained from online searches.
Several factors were considered including the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), the leaf area index (LAI), the amount of rainfall, the land surface temperature for day and night (LSTday and LSTnight), respectively, land use/land-cover (LULC), elevation and distance to the nearest water body. Environmental predictors were extracted from RS sources at spatial and temporal resolutions. 
A logistic regression model was fitted to the prevalence data. The univariate non-spatial analysis indicated that the environmental factors stated above were correlated to malaria prevalence. The malaria risk maps constructed from the spatial model indicates that malaria varies with a 20% prevalence in some states and 70% in others. The highest prevalence was found in Niger Delta states, Rivers and Bayelsa, and the northeastern and northwestern regions of the country. The north however, had more places with low prevalence. 
Maps of malaria risks are important because they guide in identifying areas at high risk and ensure resources and intervention are allocated accordingly. They help planners identify where long-term insecticide treated nets are more useful and where insecticide spray may be a better option. They also help to identify where preventive measures such as avoiding storing water in cans to prevent breeding areas, may eradicate malaria.

Inaccessibility of healthcare facilities is a major challenge that has prevented the goal of eradicating malaria in Nigeria. With the expansion of urban areas and increase in population, the need arose for accessing the accessibility of basic amenities throughout states in Nigeria. The study examines this geographic accessibility by using open data and geospatial analysis. 
For a country as populated as Nigeria, it is necessary to examine the accessibility of healthcare institutions across states, regions etc, because the inadequate access could lead to an epidemic outbreak as in the case of Ebola. People should have access to timely, affordable care, not just for their sake but for the sake of others. This particular analysis was done in Akwa-Ibom state, in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria.
The data was obtained from several sources. The elevation data was obtained from Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) 30m resolution dataset from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The data for the study area was downloaded from Earth Explorer website. The network data showing the access by road across the study area was obtained from the OpenStreet Map (OSM). This dataset contained spatial information such as road network, water features (and waterways), building, point of interests, natural features, etc. Data on the locations of Healthcare Facilities(HCF) was collected from the Vaccination Tracking System (VTS).  This dataset is made up of all HCF (public and private). However, all analyses were carried out using only a portion of the dataset on Primary Healthcare Facilities(PHCF). This was done to capture the access to the most affordable health facility to most of the populace in both urban and rural areas.
Distance to the health center was calculated using the Predictive Analysis Tool(PAT) from ArcGis. This tool supports the building of models to predict location. Time from the nearest PHCF was also calculated using the speed model from PAT. 
Out of the 458 PHCFs included in the study, most of them were concentrated in the capital city of Uyo, which is expected since it is the most populated. The ratio of population to PHCF revealed a disturbing scenario. The lowest ratio was 5363-8099 all depending on one PHCF. This was seen in 9 Local Government Areas(LGAs). About 11 other LGAs had 10700-15230 people depending on one PHCF. Due to this high amount of people, these PHCFs are burdened with the pressure and end up not being able to cater to so many people, due to lack of facilities. 
The results of the study indicated that across the 1787 settlements in the dataset, 98.3% were with good access as they were within a 30 minute range from the closest PHCF. 27 settlements were in the poor access class, while 2 were in the very poor access class. 


### Conclusion
The fight against malaria continues and we know that it is a disease that can be brought down. This is proven by the fact that a lot of countries around the world that suffered from it have succeeded in winning the war against it.
