#### What are your general thoughts on government and private company utilization of technologies that are able to recognize a face and/or match a human face from a digital image or a video frame against a database of faces? What advantages or benefits could/do such technologies provide? What role (if any) should a government play in regulating their use by individuals or companies?

I definitely believe that there are pros and cons to the use of facial recognition technologies. Facial recognition software can be used by law enforcement agencies to find missing persons, identify criminals. The presence of cameras in shops prevents stealing/shoplifting. And if something ends up getting stolen, it can be used to identify and track the perpetrators. Places like airports/border securities use facial recognition to ensure criminals/terrorists who may pose a threat to passengers, or the airlines do not come into the destination country. Banks can also use this kind of technology to prevents fraud. 

Aside from security, facial recognition offers convenience. It reduces activities that would otherwise require pin such as ATMs, phones and doors. This generally makes life easier and faster.

Some disadvantages include the threat to individual privacy. Having your face stored in a database and kept for an unknown future use is something people are averse to. And if those databases happen to be breached by hackers, then it can be used for criminal purposes, such as identity theft, fraud, money laundry. Facial recognition can also identify an innocent individual as a criminal since technology isnâ€™t perfect. This leads to false arrests and harassments. 

The only role I can think of in regards to the government regulating facial recognition is to simply ensure industries using the facial recognition technolgy ask for consent of the consumers.
