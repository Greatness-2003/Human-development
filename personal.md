My name is Greatness. I’m in my second semester of my first year at William and Mary, since I started in January. I’m an international student from Nigeria. I’m planning on majoring in Data science. I enjoy using Python libraries(pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn), SQL and R to answer data related questions and I believe that Data science as a major is the best platform to harness these skills. I think data science is the analysis of data in order to understand what’s really going on and be able to make predictions based on that. The evolution of data in recent years has proven that data can solve most problems and it’s only a matter of seeking that data to create solutions.
