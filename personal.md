###### I'd like to get to know you better. What is your general background---in a few sentences, what do you want me to know about you? What are your interests academically, intellectually, or professionally? Basically, what do you care about (no wrong answers here)? What do you think data science is? Based on your conception of data science, in a very broad sense, how (if at all) do you think it can be harnessed to improve the lives of people (their quality of life), the environment, our understanding of ourselves or nature, business & economics, everyday problem solving, or anything else


My name is Greatness. I’m in my second semester of my first year at William and Mary, since I started in January. I’m an international student from Nigeria. I’m planning on majoring in Data science. I enjoy using Python libraries(pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn), SQL and R to answer data related questions and I believe that Data science as a major is the best platform to harness these skills. I think data science is the analysis of data in order to understand what’s really going on and be able to make predictions based on that. The evolution of data in recent years has proven that data can solve most problems and it’s only a matter of seeking that data to create solutions.
